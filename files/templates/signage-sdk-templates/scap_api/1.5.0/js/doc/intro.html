						<p><b> What is SCAP? </b><br>
						SCAP(Signage Common Application Platform) is a JavaScript library that enables the use of services provided by webOS based LG Commercial Display Platform.<br> 
                        This library can be used in a web-application in the same way as other JavaScript-based libraries(e.g. jQuery). <br></p>
                        
						<p><b> What is Cordova? </b><br>
                        Cordova is a JavaScript library that enables the use of hardware features such as the camera or accelerometer in a web application. It is used to make a web application that works on a mobile operating system with UI frameworks such as jQuery Mobile, Dojo Mobile, Sencha Touch and Enyo.<br><br>
                        Cordova has the following features:<br>
                        - Can develop applications without having to use the native language provided by the mobile operating system<br>
                        - Can be distributed to a number of platforms using a single web programming code<br>
                        - Can implement common mobile operating system features using an API<br>
                        For more information about Cordova, see <a href="http://cordova.apache.org">http://cordova.apache.org.</a><br>
